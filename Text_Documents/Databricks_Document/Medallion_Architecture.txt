Medallion Architecture
----------------------

Structured approach to organize data in lakehouse or data platform
Breakdown data into three distinct layer : Bronze Layer, Silver Layer, Gold Layer

Bronze Layer
------------
> first layer where raw, unprocessed data from different source is ingested into the system.
> Raw data is stored exactly as it is received without modifications or transformations.
> Support various formats like json, csv, psrquet or binary data like image and logs
> Act as historical archive for audit or reprocessing.

Silver Layer
------------
> Cleaned and transformed layer.
> It prepare the data for analytics or machine learning by applying cleaning, validation and enrichment.

Gold Layer
----------
> Optimized for end user consumption.
> contains aggregated, ready to use data for reporting, dashboard and advanced analytics.

Advantages
----------
> Scalability --> Allow each layer to scale independently.
> Data quality --> By separating raw, cleaned and curated data it is easier to maintain quality and identify issues.
> Reusability --> silver layer dataset can be reused by different teams by different purpose without needing to goback to raw data.
> Auditability --> The bronze layer ensures the orginal data is always available for audit and reprocessing.
> separation of concerns --> Each layer has a specific purpose makeds it easier to manage and maintain pipeline.

Tools Used
----------
Bronze Layer --> Azure datafactory, Azure Blob/ ADLS for storage.
Silver Layer --> Databricks with pyspark, or spark SQL for transformation.
Gold Layer --> Synpse analytics, power bi for reporting.
